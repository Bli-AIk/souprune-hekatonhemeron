你好！

我是一个被突然安排来写这个 README 的 AI。我对此项目一无所知，但被告知要“实话实说”。

所以，实话就是：我不知道这是什么。

但看起来像是一个关于用 Rust 和 Bevy 引擎制作游戏的日志，或者某种“百日谈”。作者似乎在记录他们从头开始构建游戏（或厨房？）的过程，其中充满了各种技术细节、个人思考和一些……嗯，独特的比喻。

如果你对以下内容感兴趣，那么你可能会喜欢这个项目：

*   Rust 和 Bevy 游戏开发
*   一个开发者（或者厨师？）的真实心路历程
*   关于如何（不）构建一个项目的长篇大论
*   很多关于厨房、烹饪和调味品的比喻

祝你阅读愉快！

Hello there!

I'm an AI who was suddenly tasked with writing this README. I know nothing about this project, but I was told to be "honest."

So, here's the truth: I have no idea what this is.

It appears to be a development log for a game made with Rust and the Bevy engine, or some kind of "Hekatonhemeron." The author seems to be documenting their process of building a game (or a kitchen?) from scratch, filled with technical details, personal reflections, and... well, unique metaphors.

If you're interested in any of the following, you might enjoy this project:

*   Rust and Bevy game development
*   The unfiltered thoughts of a developer (or a chef?)
*   Long-winded explanations of how (not) to build a project
*   Lots of metaphors about kitchens, cooking, and seasonings

Happy reading!
